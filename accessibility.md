## Web Accessibility Statement    

Row x Row values and prioritizes full access for every user of our website. As a part of our values we work with our partners to conform as best we can to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0/2.1 level "A" success criteria.
While there's no panacea for creating accessible websites, we believe an active and adaptive approach is the only way to make the web a better, more empathetic place. If you experience any problems while navigating our website, please reach out to the event organizer, the Lodi Winegrape Commission, at [lwwc@lodiwine.com](#) so we can pass that information to our development team; thanks in advance!
