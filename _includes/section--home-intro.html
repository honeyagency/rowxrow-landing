			<p>We are deeply saddened to confirm the cancellation of this year’s Lodi Row x Row Festival due to an aggressive effort to help stop the spread of COVID-19. <br/><br/>This decision was extraordinarily difficult for us, but we believe it is the right one. Our winegrowers and makers care deeply about the well-being of our local and extended communities. You’re all family to us and we want to protect you. We want all who attend our events to enjoy their experience without worry.<br/><br/><strong>If you purchased tickets, your purchase will be refunded and we will reach out to you directly with more details.</strong><br/><br/>Thank you to everyone who has shared in the excitement about this year’s event. We look forward to bringing Lodi Row x Row Festival back to you bigger and better than ever before on May 14 and 15, 2021.
